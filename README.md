# Ecological Footprint analysis
The notebook ecological footprint presents a analysis of a Kaggle dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/footprintnetwork/ecological-footprint with data from the footprint network organization.
I also takes additional data from:
* Human development index:http://hdr.undp.org/en/data
* Humal life indicator:http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/WorldPopulation/Reaging/HLI.html
* Country data:https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world

The medium story https://medium.com/@pedro.hf86/the-uncomfortable-relation-between-ecological-footprint-and-human-development-401d24b69499 uses this analysis as base for discussion.

To run this notebook you will need:
* python 3.6.7
* pandas 0.23.4
* matplotlib 3.0.2
* numpy 1.15.4
* scikit-learn 0.20.2
* geopandas 0.4.0

## Content
The notebook tries to answer 3 questions:

1. How much of our worlds biocapacity are we consuming

2. A common preconception is that it is human development leads to a larger ecological footprint, is that true? how much of the ecological footprint from consumption can be explain from HDI, GDP, HLI etc.

3. Is there any way of clustering this countries that will tell us common strategies in the ecological policies. Do they seem to correlate with economic indicators.

## Conclusions

* We are currently consuming 70% more than what our world has the capacity to produce.
* Our development is closely tied to our ecological footprint
* Our ecological footprint behavior seems very much tied to our economic and human development.
